# Classification-in-depth

This a repository with a series of ML (classification) case studies I have solved. The notebooks and the results (where applicable) are also uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rnmehta5).

For more details on classification and overview of the algorithms used here please go to my blog [machine learning hands on](https://medium.com/machine-learning-hands-on).

I am a new ML practitioner so feedback and comments for improvements or words of encouragement are much appreciated!
